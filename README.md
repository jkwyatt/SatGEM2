# SatGEM2
A code repository for the creation of SatGEM2. 

## SatGEM_DIY
Allows the construction of your own SatGEM fields from a SSH field. Note, that the copernicus data is daily, so its recommended to chunk this up otherwise data output will be very large. 

## Watermass
Currently, the script for the creation of the figures is avaialable here. 
This will be set up to update figures of the 5 water mass volume and their change through time, with barystatic ssh used.
